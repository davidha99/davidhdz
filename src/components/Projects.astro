<div class="wrapper">
  <h2 class="title">What I've been working on</h2>
  <p>
    I like to stay busy and always have a project on the works. Take a look at
    some of the applications, articles and companies I've dedicated my time to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>ByteBuddy</li>
    <li>Ukko</li>
    <li>Jose's Blog</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<style>
  .title {
    font-size: 3rem;
    font-weight: 800;
  }
</style>
